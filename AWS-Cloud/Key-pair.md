# ☁️ AWS Key Pair Creation - System Admin Task

This task marks the beginning of my journey as a **System Administrator**, performed through the **KodeKloud AWS Labs** platform. The goal was to securely prepare for EC2 instance access by creating a dedicated key pair in the AWS Cloud.

---

## ✅ Task Objective

🔐 **Create a new EC2 Key Pair** in AWS with the following configuration:

- **Key Pair Name**: `xfusion-kp`
- **Key Type**: `RSA`
- **Region**: `us-east-1 (N. Virginia)`
- **Access**: Key pair file downloaded as `.pem` for SSH use

---

## 🔧 Why This Matters

Key pairs are essential in AWS for **securely connecting to EC2 Linux instances** via SSH. Instead of using a username/password combo, AWS uses **public/private key cryptography** to authenticate users safely.

This setup is especially useful during **phased cloud migrations**, like the one simulated by the **Nautilus DevOps Team**, where infrastructure is gradually transitioned to AWS.
