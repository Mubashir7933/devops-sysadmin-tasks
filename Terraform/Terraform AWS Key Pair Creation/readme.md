# Terraform AWS Key Pair Creation (`xfusion-kp`)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project demonstrates how to use **Terraform** to create an AWS **Key Pair** with the RSA algorithm, save the private key locally, and manage the process entirely as code.

It is part of the Nautilus DevOps teamâ€™s **incremental AWS migration strategy**, where infrastructure changes are deployed in small, controlled steps for minimal disruption and better risk management.

## ðŸ§  Learning Objective
By completing this task, a new DevOps engineer will learn:
- What **Terraform** is and how it works.
- How to use the **TLS** provider to generate keys.
- How to create AWS resources using code instead of the AWS Console.
- How to store sensitive files securely on the local system.
